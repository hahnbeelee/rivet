We'll include instructions for deploying with either the Rivet Dashboard or
GitHub Actions.

<Info>
**INFO**

**Should I deploy with the Rivet Dashboard or GitHub Actions?**

- Use the Rivet Dashboard if feel more comfortable with GUIs than Git and are
  working alone on a project.
- Use GitHub Actions if working with a team using Git and want automated
  deploys.

</Info>

## Step 1: Fork example repository (optional)

This guide will use our TypeScript
[example repository starter](https://github.com/rivet-gg/example-tanks-typescript-canvas-socketio)
to get you up and running. You can either fork this project or follow along with
your own project.

> TODO: Walk through forking & cloning project

> TODO: Demonstrate how to run repository

## Step 2: Create game

### Open developer dashboard & create game

### Visit default game

Rivet will automatically deploy a default game. You'll be able to visit it at
`https://{my-game-id}.rivet.game`.
[Read more about the Rivet CDN & rivet.game domain](/docs/concepts/cdn/rivet-game-domain).

## Step 3: Install the Rivet CLI

Follow the
[Rivet CLI installation steps](https://github.com/rivet-gg/cli#installing) for
your platform.

The Rivet CLI will be used to bootstrap your repository and manage your game.
Almost everything you can do in the Rivet CLI can also be done through a GUI on
the Rivet Dashboard.

## Step 4: Initialize repository

### Generate cloud token

<Warning>

**Warning**

Treat this token like a password. Anyone who has this token has complete access
to your game. Never share it with anyone or commit it to your Git repository.

</Warning>

### Initialize repository

In the root of your project's directory, run:

```
rivet init

```

You'll be prompted to input the cloud token you just created. Answer the rest of
the questions according to your needs.

<Info>

**INFO**

If you plan on deploying with the Rivet Dashboard instead of GitHub Actions,
answer `n` to integrating GitHub Actions.

</Info>

## Step 5: Integrate Rivet Matchmaker

### Create development token

We recommend making your development environment as similar to your production
environment as possible. In order to do that, Rivet can generate a
[development token](/docs/concepts/glossary#development-token) used to configure
how these responses are mocked.

1. Navigate to _API_ and click _Create Development Token_ under the _Production_
   namespace.
2. Update _Port_ to match the port that your game runs on in development. For
   the example game, this should be `5000`.
3. Click _Create_.
4. Click _Download Environment File_.

<Warning>

**Warning**

Treat this token like a password. Anyone with access to this token will have
elevated access to the namespace it was created in. Never share it with anyone
or commit it to your Git repository.

</Warning>

### Install development token

Move the `_env` file that you downloaded in the last step to `.env` in the root
of your project.

<Warning>

**Warning**

If using Git, make sure the `.env` is in your `.gitignore`. This token should be
kept private.

</Warning>

<Info>
**INFO**

We recommend using a `.env` file as a way to prevent committing your development
token to your repository for security. You may use whatever method you wish to
manage this token.
</Info>

### Install the Rivet Matchmaker package

- NPM
- Yarn
- Cargo

```
npm install --save @rivet-gg/matchmaker

```

```
yarn install --save @rivet-gg/matchmaker

```

```
cargo add rivet-matchmaker

```

### Integrate client

- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- Rust

> TODO: Explain player token

> TODO: Error handling

```
import * as mm from "@rivet-gg/matchmaker";

const mmApi = new mm.MatchmakerService({
    token: process.env.RIVET_CLIENT_TOKEN
});

const findRes = await client.mmApi.findLobby({
    gameModes: ["default"],
});

```

`findRes.lobby.ports["default"].host`

`findRes.lobby.player.token`

<Info>
**INFO**

The example project uses
(dotenv-webpack)\[https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-webpack\] to load the
`RIVET_CLIENT_TOKEN` variable from the `.env` file to the WebPack bundle.

</Info>

> TODO

> TODO

### Integrate server

- TypeScript
- JavaScript
- Rust

> TODO: Explain lobby ready

> TODO: Explain & document player lifecycle

> TODO: Error handling

```
import * as mm from "@rivet-gg/matchmaker";

const mmApi = new mm.MatchmakerService({});

await mmApi.lobbyReady({});

await mmApi.playerConnected({ playerToken });

await mmApi.playerDisconnected({ playerToken });

```

<Info>
**INFO**

The example project uses (dotenv)\[https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv\] to
load the `RIVET_LOBBY_TOKEN` variable from the `.env` file to `process.env`.
</Info>
<Info>
**INFO**
When using NodeJS, `MatchmakerService` will automatically read the
`RIVET_LOBBY_TOKEN` environment variable.
</Info>
> TODO

> TODO

<Info>
**INFO**

The example project uses [dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv) to load
the `.env` file in to the server's environment. If following along with your own
project, you will need to use the , the
[dotenv CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv-cli), or your own method to
load this file in to your game's environment.
